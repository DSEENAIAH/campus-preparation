## Project overview

This repository contains a front-end single-page application and a collection of deployment and utility scripts used to build, populate, and deploy the application to AWS (Amplify, S3, CloudFront) as well as helper scripts for local data population and maintenance.

The project appears to be built with a modern JS toolchain (Vite) and includes a `src` folder with React components, a `public` folder for static assets, and a number of PowerShell / batch and Node.js scripts for AWS provisioning, table creation, and sample data population.

This README intentionally avoids showing code snippets but documents where things live, what they do, and how to treat sensitive data.

## Top-level layout and purpose of important files/folders

- `src/` — Main application source. Contains components, contexts, pages, and app entry points.
- `public/` — Static assets served by the app (redirects, JSON samples, etc.).
- `build/` and `dist/` — Production build output directories (generated by the build process).
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` — Node.js package manifest and lockfile that declare scripts and dependencies.
- `vite.config.js` — Vite bundler configuration used by the local dev server and builds.
- `index.html` — Single-page host for the frontend application.

- Deployment & infra files:
  - `amplify.yml`, `cloudfront-config.json`, `cloudfront-spa-config.json`, `distribution-config.json`, `redirect-rules.json` — files that control hosting, redirects and CloudFront / CDN settings.
  - JSON policy files (`*.json` such as `codenvia-policy.json`, `policy-*.json`, `updated-iam-policy.json`) — IAM/policy configuration used for AWS resources.

- Utility and admin scripts:
  - Node scripts: e.g., `create-test-users.js`, `populate-colleges.js`, `populate-sample-results.js`, `test-aws-connection.js`, and other `*.js` files used to create or manipulate data.
  - Windows scripts and PowerShell: many `*.bat` and `*.ps1` files for creating tables, deploying, and fixing S3/CloudFront configuration.

## Sensitive files and secrets

While inspecting the repository, several files were found which often contain credentials, user secrets, or private keys. Treat these as sensitive and do not commit them to public repositories:

- `admin-user.json`
- `student-user.json`
- `correct-student-user.json`
- `delete-key.json`
- `.env` and any other environment variable files (for example `.env.local`)
- Any private key or certificate files (extensions like `.pem`, `.key`, `.crt`) if present
- Local AWS config directories such as `.aws/` and local SDK credential files

If any of these files contain real credentials or private keys, rotate them immediately after removing them from version control and move secrets into a secure secret store (for example AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, or your team's vault). Use environment variables or a CI/CD secret store for deployment-time secrets.

## Recommended setup (high-level, no code snippets)

1. Install project dependencies as declared in `package.json` using the package manager of your choice.
2. Use the scripts declared in `package.json` to run the development server, to build a production bundle, or to run tests. The `vite.config.js` controls local dev and build behavior.
3. Before deploying, ensure the environment variables and AWS credentials are provided securely (not committed). Use CI/CD secret storage for production credentials.
4. Review and sanitize any JSON files that contain provisioning details or IAM policies so they do not accidentally include account-specific keys.

## Deployment notes

- The repo contains a number of deployment helper files (Amplify config, CloudFront config, S3 deployment scripts). These files are orchestration/config files; keep infrastructure credentials out of repo.
- Prefer using a CI pipeline to deploy (with credentials provisioned via the pipeline/secret store) rather than committing deploy credentials to disk.

## Developer hygiene & recommended practices

- Add/keep a `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of local secrets and build artifacts (a starter `.gitignore` was added to this repo to exclude common sensitive files). Review it and adapt to your team's needs.
- Move any file that contains secrets into a secure store and replace with examples or templates that do not contain real secrets. If a secrets file must exist locally for testing, maintain a `*.example` template without secrets (for instance `.env.example`).
- Run audits on committed blobs to ensure keys were not previously committed; if they were, rotate them.

## Files that look like useful documentation or notes

- `DEV_NOTES.md` — developer notes were present; review this first for any repo-specific guidance.

## How to contribute

- When adding new scripts or configuration files that might include sensitive values, add a `*.example` file with the same keys but no secrets and update the `.gitignore` if needed.
- For changes to deployment or IAM policies, prefer pull requests with reviewers from the security or infra team.

## Final notes

This README was created by analyzing repository files and aims to provide a privacy-first guide: it intentionally does not embed code snippets or secret values. If you want, I can next produce a sanitized `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or automatically move any discovered secrets into a secure pattern and replace them with templates.
